## FAQ

### How Should I Dress?

There is not a dress code at Immanuel Baptist Church for members or guests. Our ministry leaders and many of our church family dress in more traditional “Sunday” dress; however, our main goal is that you would feel welcome and comfortable on your visit here at Immanuel Baptist!

### Am I Expected to Participate in the Offering?

No. We don't invite you to Immanuel Baptist Church for your offering. We want our service to be a gift to you. We hope you will find in this place a warm family spirit, truth from God's Word, and a place where you can grow in God's grace. Please don't feel any obligation to participate in the offering as a guest.

### What about my children?

IBC has Sunday school classes for your children at 10AM (led by their respective Sunday school teachers). IBC also provides a loving nursery for your infants and toddlers during all services.
