## Welcome

Welcome to Immanuel Baptist Church online! We are so excited that you are taking the time to visit our website. Thank you for your interest. On this site, you will find ministry information, our doctrinal stand, answers to frequently asked questions, audio sermons, and much more. I trust that this web site will be a help to you.

Immanuel Baptist Church has been home for my wife and me for the past 13 years. We have enjoyed the journey of serving the King of kings from this city and from this place. Our Lord has blessed us with wonderful people who have hearts for the work of Christ. I trust that you will not only become acquainted with the ministry, but also come see us in the near future if at all possible.

Should you have any questions, please feel free to send us a note at enriquecastro777@yahoo.com or call the church offices at (661) 725-0479.

Please pray for us and for the work that our Lord is accomplishing at Immanuel Baptist. We would love to see you soon! God bless you.

Your Friend, <br>
Enrique Castro, pastor
